i want to create a 2 page portal which has to be hosted on an ip. the first page is a login page which takes IDP ID and password. there is also a field for mobile number for 2fa. once the user logs in with their idp id they can view the mis reports based on the filters they select. they should also have an option to download the reports in a .csv file. any particular user who logs in with their idp id should be able to see only the mis reports of that specific id and no one else. I am attaching the .py file of the backend and sending the url of the git repository. am i doing everything right? let me know the changes and what else has to be done

as of now, how the webpage works is that we can filter the date and then there are two dropdowns; the first one shows options, entity and invoice in the drop down. the second drop down has 14 options and then there is an apply button which showsus data based on the filters we have selected. the reports post filter have the data of all idp codes and their entities and invoices etc. correct me if this is not how it works.
