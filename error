# Here are some potential security and malware related problems in this code:

# SQL Injection: The code uses string concatenation to build SQL queries, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. An attacker could inject malicious SQL code by manipulating the input data.

# Unvalidated User Input: The code does not validate or sanitize user input, which makes it vulnerable to various types of attacks, including SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and command injection.

# Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR): The code uses user-provided IDs to access and manipulate data, which makes it vulner able to IDOR attacks. An attacker could manipulate the IDs to access or modify sensitive data.

# Lack of Input Validation: The code does not validate or check the format of user input, which makes it vulnerable to various types of attacks, including buffer overflow attacks.

# Use of Sensitive Data: The code handles sensitive data, such as passwords and user credentials, which makes it a high-value target for attackers.

# Lack of Encryption: The code does not encrypt sensitive data, which makes it vulnerable to interception and unauthorized access.

# Use of Outdated or Vulnerable Dependencies: The code uses various dependencies, such as FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, which may have known vulnerabilities or outdated versions.

# Insufficient Error Handling: The code does not handle errors and exceptions properly, which makes it vulnerable to crashes and data corruption.

# Lack of Authentication and Authorization: The code does not implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, which makes it vulnerable to unauthorized access and data manipulation.

Code Injection: The code uses dynamic code execution, which makes it vulnerable to code injection attacks. An attacker could inject malicious code by manipulating the input data.

To address these issues, it's recommended to:

Use parameterized queries or ORM libraries to prevent SQL injection.
Validate and sanitize user input to prevent various types of attacks.
Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive data.
Use encryption to protect sensitive data.
Keep dependencies up-to-date and patch known vulnerabilities.
Implement proper error handling and logging mechanisms.
Use secure coding practices, such as input validation and secure data storage.
Implement secure communication protocols, such as HTTPS, to protect data in transit.

Input validation: The code includes several functions to validate input data, such as validate_signature and fin_req_validation. These functions help ensure that the incoming requests contain valid data and signatures. However, it's essential to ensure that all input data is appropriately validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS).
Error handling: The code includes error handling mechanisms, such as returning appropriate error codes and messages. However, it's essential to ensure that error messages do not reveal sensitive information that could be used by an attacker.
Access control: The code includes functions to retrieve data from the database, such as db.query(MerchantDetails).filter(MerchantDetails.merchant_key == merchant_key).first(). It's essential to ensure that only authorized users can access this data and that appropriate access control mechanisms are in place.
Data encryption: The code includes functions to encrypt and decrypt data, such as encrypt_aes_256 and decrypt_aes_256. It's essential to ensure that sensitive data is always encrypted in transit and at rest and that appropriate encryption keys are used and managed securely.
Logging: The code includes logging mechanisms, such as logger.info and logger.error. It's essential to ensure that logging mechanisms do not reveal sensitive information that could be used by an attacker.
Overall, while the code includes several security mechanisms, it's essential to ensure that all input data is appropriately validated and sanitized, that error messages do not reveal sensitive information, that access control mechanisms are in place, that sensitive data is always encrypted, and that logging mechanisms do not reveal sensitive information.

# invoice_hub_dash.py
Duplicate code: The TagsMetadata class has duplicate code for gsp_user_info and consent_user_info. Consider refactoring the code to avoid duplication.
Inconsistent indentation: The code uses both spaces and tabs for indentation, which can lead to formatting issues. Ensure that the code uses consistent indentation.
Code organization: The code is not well-organized, with many unrelated functions and classes in a single file. Consider breaking the code into smaller, more focused modules.
Code comments: The code lacks comments and documentation, making it difficult to understand. Add comments and docstrings to explain the code's purpose and behavior.
